## Begin

For PC, a freely-licensed [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) is a 
good option to get rid of the nasty `telemetry` in the popular **M$** product.

You can also `code` **Docus** in your browser with **Stackblitz**:

## VSCodium
 More **Documentation** on the program can be found at [Github](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium/blob/master/DOCS.md).
- Removing `telemetry` and using free `extensions` is a good idea.

## Stackblitz

 One of the most interesting browser coding environments, no **installation** needed.
- Easy to [fork](https://developer.stackblitz.com/guides/user-guide/importing-projects) **Github** repos by using only the address bar, for example:
```bash
stackblitz.com/github/{GH_USERNAME}/{REPO_NAME}
```
- A button can be added to the **MDC** pages:
```bash
:button-link[StackBlitz]{size="small" icon="IconStackBlitz" href="https://stackblitz.com/github/nuxt-themes/docus-starter" blank}
```
- You can even embed a project to the **Documentation** pages:
```bash
::sandbox{repo="nuxt/nuxt" branch="main" dir="examples/essentials/hello-world" file="app.vue"} ::
```
## Codesandbox
Another great browser-based environment, a bit more adjustments needed sometimes.
- [Codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) may need the **depencies** to be manually installed with Nuxt, those can be found in `package.json`.
- Aside form the embed option, a button can be added to the **Documentation**:

```bash
:button-link[Play on CodeSandbox]{icon="IconCodeSandBox" href="https://codesandbox.io/s/github/nuxt-themes/docus-starter" blank}
```
:button-link[Play on CodeSandbox]{icon="IconCodeSandBox" href="https://codesandbox.io/s/github/nuxt-themes/docus-starter" blank}
## Nuxt

The **Docus** theme is built on [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction) Framework, including **auto imports** meaning less typing and searching.

- Many really easy to use [Modules](https://nuxt.com/modules), just install:
```bash
npm install --save-dev @nuxt/content
```
And add it to the `nuxt.config.ts`
```bash
 modules: [
    '@nuxt/content'
  ],
```
Themes and such can be added as **extends**:
```bash
extends: '@nuxt-themes/docus'
```
