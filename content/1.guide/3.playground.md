## Play around
:ellipsis
It is easier to understand how things work through examples. Luckily **Nuxt** has many of them.

- [Nuxt Examples](https://nuxt.com/docs/examples/essentials/hello-world)
- [Content Examples](https://content.nuxtjs.org/examples/essentials/hello-world)

## Hints
- Browser might use a lot of memory and decent amount of bandwith.
- `nuxt/ui` dependency is for the looks.
- The slider can be moved to the right side to see the files on **Codesandbox** embed.
- Some examples might be a bit outdated, see [Releases](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/releases)
